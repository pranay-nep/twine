# 🏚️ Haunted House (Twine Game)

Welcome to **Haunted House**, a spooky interactive fiction game developed using **Twine**. Enter if you dare—this eerie text-based adventure is filled with puzzles, mystery, and branching choices that test your wits and courage.

## 🎮 About the Game

In **Haunted House**, players explore a creepy, abandoned estate in search of clues, secrets, and a way out. The story unfolds based on your choices, with items to find, rooms to explore, and paths that change depending on your actions.

This project was built collaboratively by our team as part of a creative coding challenge. We used the **`.twee`** format to allow for better version control and collaboration within a Git repository.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Twine](https://twinery.org/) (for interactive fiction development)
- Twee format (`.twee`) for story scripting
- Harlowe story format
- HTML/JavaScript (compiled by Twine for deployment)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Haunted_House_Final.twee` — Main story script written in Twee format.
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Download [Twine](https://twinery.org/) or use the [online Twine editor](https://twinery.org/2/).
2. Import the `Haunted_House_Final.twee` file.
